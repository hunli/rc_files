# rc_files
Contains RC files for convenience. Removed the period in front of the name so that the files are not hidden.

The bashrc file contains useful environment variables to export and alias shortcuts. This is not a complete bashrc file so it's recommended that the desired lines are copied into an existing bashrc file.
